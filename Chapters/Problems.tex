\section{Physics problems}
\subsection{Cosmology}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Maybe write a classification logistic regressor, or deep CNN to classify where dark matter halos have their boundary. It is very difficult to define a boundary of such a spread out object with confidence, maybe find criteria via classification ML technique ?
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{QFT}
\section{Ai safety}
\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Can you define multiple hierarchical utility functions to implement Asimov's laws via reinforcement learning ?
\end{enumerate}
\section{Knobel-problems}
\subsection{Ideas}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Write a CNN which looks at a Sudoku picture, converting it into a Sudoku data grid, then solve it via python ?
\end{enumerate}
